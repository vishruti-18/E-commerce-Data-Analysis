# E-commerce Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The dataset consists of multiple CSV files covering various aspects of the e-commerce operations, including customers, orders, sellers, products, payments, and more.

## Project Description

The main objectives of this project are to:

- **Analyze Customer Distribution**: Identify unique cities where customers are located.
- **Order Trends**: Count the number of orders placed in specific years and analyze order trends over time.
- **Sales Analysis**: Determine total sales per product category and the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.
- **Payment Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of orders paid in installments.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze the number of customers from each state, average number of products per order by city, and top customers based on spending.
- **Revenue and Sales Insights**: Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, the moving average of order values, and cumulative sales per month.
- **Customer Retention and Growth**: Calculate the retention rate of customers and the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following CSV files:

- **customers.csv**: Contains customer details.
- **orders.csv**: Contains order details.
- **sellers.csv**: Contains seller information.
- **products.csv**: Contains product details.
- **geolocation.csv**: Contains geographical data.
- **payments.csv**: Contains payment information.
- **order_items.csv**: Contains details of items in each order.

## Setup and Installation
